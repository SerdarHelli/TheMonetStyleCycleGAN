# TheMonetStyleCycleGAN



[Iâ€™m Something of a Painter Myself- KAGGLE Competition :](https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started/overview)

"
The Challenge:
A GAN consists of at least two neural networks: a generator model and a discriminator model. The generator is a neural network that creates the images. For our competition, you should generate images in the style of Monet. This generator is trained using a discriminator.

The two models will work against each other, with the generator trying to trick the discriminator, and the discriminator trying to accurately classify the real vs. generated images.
